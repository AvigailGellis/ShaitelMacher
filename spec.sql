Hi, I am a shaitel macher for some time now, and things have gotten very dissorganized over the years. 
It was time for a program to keep my place in order.

I need to keep track of all my appointments and the profit earned on each appointment, on some appointments I sell a shaitel 
so I also need to record the price of the shaitel.

I need to be able to generate the following reports:

1) A list of all appointments for the day, in the following format
    Row for the day
    Time, First name, Last name, If they're buying a new shitle, How much they need to pay

2) A report with the profit for every week/month
3) A report withthe profit on sales, and for appointments separately
4) I need a report of profit per shaitel brand
5) How much I need to pay all the shaitel suppliers


Question: Can someone buy a new shaitel at the same time style an old one?
Answer: They can but that would be two appointments in the system.
 
Question: Can an appointment be canceled?
Answer: Yes upto 24 hours before, otherwise they have to pay.

Question: How much in advanced can an appointment be booked?
Answer: Upto 6 month in advance.

If you have any more questions please reach out to me.

Tzippy Berger appt 12:30 tue 10/12/22 , New shaitel for $1200 it costed $900.
