Hi, I am a sheitel macher for some time now, and things have gotten very disorganized over the years. 
It was time for a program to keep my place in order.

I need to keep track of all my appointments and the profit earned on each appointment, on some appointments I sell a sheitel 
so I also need to record the price of the sheitel.

Appointments are between 9 to 5 and are every half an hour 00 and 30.

I need to be able to generate the following reports:

1) A list of all appointments for the day, in the following format
    Row for the day
    Time, First name, Last name, If they're buying a new sheitel, How much they need to pay

2) A report with the profit for every week/month
3) A report with the profit on sales, and for appointments separately
4) I need a report of profit per sheitel brand
5) How much I need to pay all the sheitel suppliers


Question: Can someone buy a new sheitel at the same time style an old one? Can someone style two sheitels at the same appointment?
Answer: They can but that would be two appointments in the system, so that we can keep track of the available time.
 
Question: Can an appointment be canceled?
Answer: Yes up to 24 hours before, otherwise they have to pay.

Question: How much in advanced can an appointment be booked?
Answer: Minimum 48 hours up to 6 month in advance.

Question: When someone buys a new sheitel do they also pay for the appointment?
Answer: No it's all inclusive in the price. But if they cancel with in 24 hours then they have to pay $40 for the appointment. 

Question: When someone buys a sheitel is the price and brand known before hand?
Answer: Yes the appointment is for cutting and styling. Choosing the sheitel happens before hand without an appointment.


If you have any more questions please reach out to me.
