Hi, I am a shaitel macher for some time now, and things have gotten very dissorganized over the years. 
It was time for a program to keep my place in order.

I need to keep track of all my appointments and the profit earned on each appointment, on some appointments I sell a shaitel 
so I also need to record the price of the shaitel.

Appointments are between 9 to 5 and are every half an hour 00 and 30.

I need to be able to generate the following reports:

1) A list of all appointments for the day, in the following format
    Row for the day
    Time, First name, Last name, If they're buying a new shitle, How much they need to pay

2) A report with the profit for every week/month
3) A report with the profit on sales, and for appointments separately
4) I need a report of profit per shaitel brand
5) How much I need to pay all the shaitel suppliers


Question: Can someone buy a new shaitel at the same time style an old one?
Answer: They can but that would be two appointments in the system.
 
Question: Can an appointment be canceled?
Answer: Yes upto 24 hours before, otherwise they have to pay.

Question: How much in advanced can an appointment be booked?
Answer: Minimum 48 hours Upto 6 month in advance.

Question: When someone buys a new shaitel do they also pay for the appointment?
Answer: No its all inclusive in the price. But if they cancel with in 24 hours then they have to pay $40 for the appointment. 

Question: When someone buys a shaitel is the price and brand known before hand?
Answer: Yes the appointment is for cutting and styling. Choosing the shaitel happens before hand without an appointment.


If you have any more questions please reach out to me.
